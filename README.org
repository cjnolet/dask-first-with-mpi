* Introduction
This is a testing ground for "dask-first" approach being discussed [[https://github.com/dask/dask-mpi/issues/25#issuecomment-469546424][here]].
* Pre-reqs
- python (v3.7.1)
  - dask
  - distributed
  - cython
- gcc (v5.4.0)
- openmpi (3.1.3)
Versions for the above dependencies were mentioned here because those were the
ones used to test the code here!
* Usage
** Singleton MPI
Hello world singleton MPI where dask worker processes behave like MPI processes
before going back to the dask world. Not that this uses the out-of-band function
launch feature of dask.
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
cd hello-mpi
python setup.py install --user
cd ..
python ./launch.py -module hello_mpi -nWorkers 2 -mpi
#+END_SRC
